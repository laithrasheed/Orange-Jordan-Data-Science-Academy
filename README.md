# Orange-Jordan-Data-Science-Academy
The Graduation Project for the bootcamp of data science offered by Orange-Jordan
Currently is availbe the machine part jupyter notbook, noting that it is implemnted by hard working during the bootcamp, and i had to perform more than 15 experiments to obtain the presented f1 score. 
it is worth to mention that this project was also contributed through other colleagues in general, but the custome functions are completly defined by Laith Rasheed. 

Finally, the future files for this repository are in-progress to be published, and they are : 
1- A Jupyter notebook for the EDA of the complete datasets before splitting it into 3 datasets (train, validate, and test)
2- A Tableau link to the visualziation performed for both, the complete dataset before splitting it (during the EDA stage), and another vidsualization for the train dataset ONLY, in order to assess the performance of the machine learning model and analize the accuracy for Random Forest and other possible Algorithms could be used.
