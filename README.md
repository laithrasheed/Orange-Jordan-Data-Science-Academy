# Orange-Jordan-Data-Science-Academy
The Graduation Project for the bootcamp of data science offered by Orange-Jordan
Currently is available the machine part Jupiter notebook, noting that it is implemented by hard working during the bootcamp, and i had to perform more than 15 experiments to obtain the presented f1 score. 
it is worth to mention that this project was also contributed through other colleagues in general, but the custom functions are completely defined by Laith Rasheed. 

Finally, the future files for this repository are in-progress to be published, and they are : 
1- A Jupyter notebook for the EDA of the complete datasets before splitting it into 3 datasets (train, validate, and test)
2- A Tableau link to the visualization performed for both, the complete dataset before splitting it (during the EDA stage), and another visualization for the train dataset ONLY, in order to assess the performance of the machine learning model and analyse the accuracy for Random Forest and other possible Algorithms could be used. 
## please note that I have uploaded an INCORRECT notebook to learn from our mistakes, and the corrected notebook that predicts the target correctly without, bias to a class, data leakage, nor model cheating while prediction test data!
